# A Stabilization of Drone-Projected Image based on Flight Information
- In order to make a movable display projecting onto high-rise walls or arbitrary objects in physical space as a digital signage, a system, called a drone-projector, is investigated with a beam projector mounted on a drone in this paper. 
- The main issue when an image is projected using the drone-projector is distortions due to variations in position and orientation by GPS error and vibration occurring from motors of rotors during flight. 
- Even though the proposed drone-projector in this paper is invented with considering stability such as center of gravity and payload of the drone, the projected image by the drone-projector still has distortions.
- Therefore, a software-based stabilization method is proposed by geometrical
modeling to compensate the distortions of the projected image in this paper.
